   :name: Flash Operations Scheduler

   Print "Hello World" to the console.

Overview
********

A Sample to showcase the usage of the Flash Operations Scheduler Driver from MCU_PLUS_SDK
and write to the Flash while the Flash is being used in the DAC mode for other usecases.

Building and Running
********************

This application can be built and executed on QEMU as follows:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/flash_operations_scheduler
   :host-os: unix
   :board: am261x_lp
   :goals: run
   :compact:

To build for another board, change "am261x_lp" above to that board's name.
